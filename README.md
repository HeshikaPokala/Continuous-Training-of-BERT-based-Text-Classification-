# Continuous-Training-of-BERT-based-Text-Classification-
Implemented a scalable BERT-based text classification pipeline with automated retraining triggered by data drift detection using Wasserstein Distance. The project features real-time and batch processing, tokenizer integration, and utilizes MLflow for model lifecycle management.
